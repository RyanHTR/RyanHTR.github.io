<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an Associate Professor at School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology. I received my Bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2018 and my PhD degree from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Jizhong Han](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hjz). I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Si Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-QtVtNEAAAAJ) leading the [ColaLab](https://www.colalab.net/) at Beihang University from 2018 to 2024. I have published more than 20 papers in cutting-edge international conferences and journals, including TPAMI, TIP, CVPR, ECCV, ACM MM, etc. I have been awarded the Special Prize of President Scholarship for Postgraduate Students of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023 and the Best Paper Runner-Up of PRCV 2020. I have worked as a research intern at SenseTime and Meituan, and have been a reviewer for top conferences and journals. My research interest includes computer vision and multimedia analysis, focusing on multimodal visual perception.
